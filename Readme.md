## To-Do List Sample Application with Flask

This appication is inspired and based on the tutorial by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask). It was used as a live demo during a staff lecture of EECS 398 Computing for Computer Scientists, taught at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in Winter 2018.

The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to build a basic RESTful API in Python using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
